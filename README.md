# OLD CAR GAME

As a child, When I am bored I used to play the retro style games like dodge cars, snake game etc. on my Aunt's phone. So yesterday when I am bored I think of recreating the car game to experience that feeling again and polish my pygame skills. So I used the python and the pygame module to acheive that feeling and recreated the game using basic pygame programming and create a duplicate car dodging game. In this game you just have to avoid the cars which are approaching you and try to create a high score.
